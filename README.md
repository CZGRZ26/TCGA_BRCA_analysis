# TCGA_BRCA_analysis
Analysis of RNA-seq gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-BRCA: Breast Invasive Carcinoma).
This project analyzes RNA-seq gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-BRCA: Breast Invasive Carcinoma).
We compare tumor vs normal breast tissue to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), visualize key results, and perform functional enrichment analysis.

The pipeline is designed for reproducibility and can be applied to other TCGA cancer datasets with minor modifications.
