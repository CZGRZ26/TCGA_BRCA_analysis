Methods & Workflow

1. Data Acquisition

Data downloaded from TCGA using TCGAbiolinks.

Focused on Transcriptome Profiling → Gene Expression Quantification → STAR - Counts.

2. Preprocessing

Filtered for tumor (TP) and normal (NT) samples.

Constructed metadata for sample grouping.

3. Differential Expression (DE) Analysis

Performed with DESeq2.

Log2 fold change shrinkage applied (ashr).

Annotated Ensembl IDs → HGNC gene symbols (org.Hs.eg.db).

4. Visualization

Volcano plot: highlights significant DEGs.

Heatmap: top 30 most significant DEGs.

PCA & sample clustering: to check group separation (QC).

5. Functional Enrichment Analysis

GO (Gene Ontology) enrichment with clusterProfiler.

Pathway analysis (KEGG / Reactome).

6. (Optional) Survival Analysis

Clinical survival data merged from TCGA.

Kaplan-Meier plots for selected genes.


#Key Results

Volcano Plot: Clear separation of up- and down-regulated genes.

Heatmap: Distinct clustering of Tumor vs Normal samples.

Enrichment: Significant pathways involved in breast cancer biology (e.g., cell cycle, immune signaling).

Survival (optional): Expression of specific DEGs correlated with overall survival.
